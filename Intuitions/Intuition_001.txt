For two numbers to differ by only one digit in their binary representations, the difference should definitely be the power of 2 of that differentiating digit position.
For example the difference between 01101 and 01001 is 2^2.
So, I have started to form a sequence of numbers satisfying the condition(differ by only one digit) starting from 0.
Let's assume that a permutation of 'N'(a power of 2) numbers satisfying the condition is formed already. We need to find a sequence of '2*N' numbers satisfying the condition.
As the 'N' numbers(in binary representations) already satisfy the given condition the reverse of the numbers(binary representations) also differ by only one digit.

Consider the sequence 00,01,11,10 --> They satisfy the condition. So the reverse 10,11,01,00 --> also satisfy the condition.
And also just carefully observe how binary numbers expand i.e. sequence of first 4 numbers (0,1,2,3) are represented by 00,01,10,11. If we expand it to first 8 i.e (2*4) numbers,
all we do is put a '0' infront of (00,01,10,11) and '1' infront of (00,01,10,11) and hence we form (0-00,0-01,0-10,0-11,1-00,1-01,1-10,1-11) the sequence of first 8 numbers.

Combining the above 2 observations, I have arrived at a solution which is,
If we have a N-number permutation satisfying the given condition(00,01,11,10), reverse the permutation which also satisfies the condition(10,11,01,00).
Append first 'N' number permutation with '0' as prefix and '1' as prefix to the reverse N-number permutation. (0-00,0-01,0-11,0-10,1-10,1-11,1-01,1-00).
The resulting 2*N number permutation also satisfies the given conditions. This way we can start with 0,1 and keep expanding it 2 times to form any number permutation.

Example:
3-number permutation formed by expanding 2-number permutation is as follows:
000    --   0
001    --   1
011    --   3  
010    --   2
110    --   6  -- (4+2)
111    --   7  -- (4+3)
101    --   5  -- (4+1)
100    --   4  -- (2^2)

We can clearly now see that the sequence is formed as follows:
First fix the (2*N)th number (here 4) in it's position.
(N+1) to (2*N-1) permutation is formed as follows: P[N+k-1] = P[N-k] where k varies from 1 to N-1.
