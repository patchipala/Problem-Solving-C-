Given two integers N and A, print a permutation K(0,1,2,...,(2^n)-1) such that
--> The permutation starts with A,
--> Consecutive numbers in the permutation differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
--> The first and last elements of the permutation must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.

Input:
N A
Output:
Permutation satisfying the above conditions.

Example:
Input:
2 1
Output:
1 3 2 0

Explanation:
1(01) 3(11) 2(10) 0(00) --> The consecutive elements differ by only one digit. The first and last elements differ by only one digit.
